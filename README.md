# Data_Analysis

You will find 3 data analysis notebooks in this repository: inspiration by App Brewery course "100 days of Code - The complete Python Pro Bootcamp", code, with upsides and flaws, by myself (no solution provided).

Here there are data analysis notebooks about:
- Space launches from the first Sputnik up to nowadays (dataset by nextspaceflight.com);
- casualties involving Police in the USA (dataset from the Washington Post);
- predicting salaries running multivariable regression on education and working years (dataset from National Longitudinal Survey of Youth 1997-2011).

Analysis were made using Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and other data science tools.
